# TestNavigationPage
I have tried to create this little XF project to study how NavigationPage works. In this project I have a PageLogin that it's outside the Navigation stack and then a PageInNavigation that is created every time I do a Push or PushModal (with different layouts). 
Now it has
- Push
- Pop
- PushModal
- PopToRoot

I have a problem with a Push inside a Modal page... a "PushAsync is not supported globally on" appears...
